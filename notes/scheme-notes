MIT Scheme

where is the deb put it in worldlang

If you are running 64 bit versions of Ubuntu download this Debian Package.
To install "cd" to your download directory and run "sudo dpkg -i mit-scheme-x64_9.0.1-1_amd64.deb", this will probably fail. Regardless of the outcome of the previous command run "sudo apt-get install -f emacs".
As the package works now it doesn't properly start with typing scheme. To fix this run "sudo ln -s -T /usr/local/bin/mit-scheme-x86-64 /usr/local/bin/mit-scheme". You should be able to use scheme just like at school.

where is the tarball.. put it in worldlang

nstallation instructions:

Download the system (a TAR file, compressed with gzip) into a temporary directory of your choice. You can get an appropriate tarball from this directory. The file you want is something that looks like scmutils-20130901-x86-64-gnu-linux.tar.gz. The long number is the date it was made. The AMDx86-64 or x86-64 is for 64-bit pc architecture machines running GNU/Linux, and the ix86 is for 32-bit pc architecture machines running GNU/Linux. Your file is about 30 megabytes long. (There are also some MIT/GNU scheme system files that start mit-scheme. These are not needed for our class.)

Be sure you are logged in with root privileges. If your system does not have a directory /usr/local, you will need to create one. Then execute the command lines:
cd /usr/local 
tar -xvzf [your-tarball.tar.gz]

The command line to start the Scheme mechanics system is 
/usr/local/bin/mechanics
(If /usr/local/bin is on your search path you need not specify the whole path.)
